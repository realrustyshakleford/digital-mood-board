# Digital Mood Board
Welcome to the Digital Mood Board, my first app build, focusing on a digital mood board creator and developed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. For my development environment, I used Zed as the code editor (after considering Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code and Nova), Git to manage my code changes and Google Chrome for testing.

Once I complete the initial build, I plan to keep tinkering with the app to continue improving my development skills.

As of May 5, 2025, the app is functional – barely – but requires a lot of reiterating, fine tuning and testing to be ready to deploy as a viable app people will want to use. Initial testing has identified several issues with the UI and UX plus some of the few features currently included in the build. My next steps include customizing (and improving) the UI, UX and features to provide a smoother experience with fully functional features. Once the basic app is in a deployable state (i.e., with an acceptable UI and UX plus all of the basic features), I will begin adding new features and funcionalities.

Some new features and updated funcionalities I plan to add include:
- implementing a save/load system to persist mood boards;
- adding user authentication to save boards to a server;
- including social sharing options;
- adding a dark mode;
- optimizing overall performance by compressing uploaded images to reduce the file size; and
- using "lazy loading" for images to improve page load times.

I plan to deploy the app using Netlify (or Vercel or GitHub Pages) and make the app accessible via a URL. I'll also set up version control by initializing a Git repository in my project folder and pushing my code to GitHub.
