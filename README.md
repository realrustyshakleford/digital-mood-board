# Digital Mood Board
Welcome to the Digital Mood Board, my first app build, focusing on a digital mood board creator and developed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
For my development environment, I used Zed as the code editor (after considering Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code and Nova), Git to manage my code changes and Google Chrome for testing.
Once I complete the initial build, I plan to keep tinkering with the app to continue improving my development skills.
